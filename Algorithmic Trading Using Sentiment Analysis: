Introduction to SVM
Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful yet flexible supervised machine learning algorithms which are used both for classification and regression. 
But generally, they are used in classification problems. In 1960s, SVMs were first introduced but later they got refined in 1990. SVMs have their unique way of implementation as compared to other machine learning algorithms. Lately, they are extremely popular because of their ability to handle multiple continuous and categorical variables.

Working of SVM
An SVM model is basically a representation of different classes in a hyperplane in multidimensional space. The hyperplane will be generated in an iterative manner by SVM so that the error can be minimized. The goal of SVM is to divide the datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH).

Margin
The followings are important concepts in SVM −

Support Vectors − Datapoints that are closest to the hyperplane is called support vectors. Separating line will be defined with the help of these data points.

Hyperplane − As we can see in the above diagram, it is a decision plane or space which is divided between a set of objects having different classes.

Margin − It may be defined as the gap between two lines on the closet data points of different classes. It can be calculated as the perpendicular distance from the line to the support vectors. Large margin is considered as a good margin and small margin is considered as a bad margin.

The main goal of SVM is to divide the datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH) and it can be done in the following two steps −

First, SVM will generate hyperplanes iteratively that segregates the classes in best way.

Then, it will choose the hyperplane that separates the classes correctly.
